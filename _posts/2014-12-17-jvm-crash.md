Run the Eclipse in my laptop(RHEL 6.4), it worked quite fine for a long time, but today while trying to open a class file to edit, the eclipse crashed with the following line error

~~~
java: cairo-misc.c:380: _cairo_operator_bounded_by_source: Assertion `NOT_REACHED' failed.

I also test run Eclipse with different version of java, the crash always existed, check from RHEL `/var/log/messages` the error log like:

## Resolution

Upgreade the java version can't resolve the issue, but upgrade the eclipse version from `4.3.2.M20140221-1700` to `4.4.1.M20140925-0400` resolved the issue.
