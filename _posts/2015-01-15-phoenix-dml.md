[Apache Phoenix](http://phoenix.apache.org/)is a relational database layer over HBase delivered as a client-embedded JDBC driver targeting low latency queries over HBase data. ]The [TestPhoenixDML](https://github.com/kylinsoong/data/blob/master/phoenix-quickstart/src/test/java/org/apache/phoenix/teiid/TestPhoenixDML.java) use Phoenix to execute a series DML unit test, including:

* testMetaData
* testInsert
* testBatchedInsert
* testSelect
* testSelectOrderBy
* testSelectGroupBy
* testSelectLimit
* testConditionAndOr
* testConditionComparison
* testFunctions
* testTimesTypes

The Coresponding SQL like:

~~~
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Customer"("ROW_ID" VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY, "customer"."city" VARCHAR, "customer"."name" VARCHAR, "sales"."amount" VARCHAR, "sales"."product" VARCHAR)
